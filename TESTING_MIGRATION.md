# Testing Migration Summary

This document summarizes the migration of all VS Code extension tests from Jest to Mocha with real VS Code extension host testing.

## Migration Overview

Successfully migrated tests for three VS Code extensions:
- `auto-config`
- `layout-builder` 
- `weaver`

## Changes Made

### 1. Package.json Updates
For each extension:
- Removed Jest dependencies: `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/jest`
- Added Mocha dependencies: `mocha`, `@types/mocha`, `@vscode/test-electron`, `@types/glob`, `glob`
- Updated test script from `"test": "jest"` to `"test": "node ./out/test/runTest.js"` or similar
- Updated pretest script to compile tests and extension before running

### 2. TypeScript Configuration
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to change types from `["jest", "node", "vscode"]` to `["mocha", "node", "vscode"]`
- Added `skipLibCheck: true` where needed to handle transitive dependency type issues

### 3. Test Infrastructure
Created new test infrastructure for each extension:
- `src/test/runTest.ts` - Test runner using @vscode/test-electron
- `src/test/suite/index.ts` - Mocha test suite configurator
- `src/test/suite/extension.test.ts` - Migrated test cases

### 4. Test Workspace Setup
Created `test-workspace/` directories with appropriate test files:
- **auto-config**: Configuration files (themes.json, etc.)
- **layout-builder**: Source files (input.cpp, script.js, result.cpp, log.txt)
- **weaver**: Basic test workspace

### 5. Test Migration Strategy

#### From Jest Mocks to Real VS Code APIs
- **Before**: Used `jest.mock('vscode')` with extensive VS Code API mocking
- **After**: Tests run in actual VS Code extension host with real APIs

#### Test Structure Changes
- **Before**: `describe()` and `it()` (Jest)
- **After**: `suite()` and `test()` (Mocha TDD interface)

#### Assertion Libraries
- **Before**: Jest assertions (`expect().toBe()`)
- **After**: Node.js built-in assertions (`assert.strictEqual()`, `assert.ok()`)

### 6. Specific Extension Adaptations

#### Auto-Config Extension
- Tests verify configuration file management and VS Code settings integration
- Focus on real workspace folder operations and configuration loading

#### Layout-Builder Extension  
- Tests verify command registration and file operations
- Includes integration tests for the 2x2 grid command functionality
- Tests workspace file access and editor operations

#### Weaver Extension
- Tests focus on webview provider registration and lifecycle
- Handles extension activation/deactivation scenarios
- Tests environment variable handling for tool configuration

## Key Benefits

1. **Real Environment Testing**: Tests now run in actual VS Code extension host
2. **Better Integration Testing**: Can test actual VS Code API interactions
3. **Reduced Maintenance**: No need to maintain complex VS Code API mocks
4. **More Reliable**: Tests reflect real extension behavior in VS Code

## Test Results

All extensions now have:
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ All tests passing in VS Code extension host
- ✅ Real VS Code API integration
- ✅ Proper error handling and edge case testing

## Files Removed

For each extension, the following Jest-related files were removed:
- `jest.config.js`
- `src/test/setup.ts`
- `src/test/__mocks__/vscode.ts`
- `src/test/extension.generated.test.ts` (Jest-based tests)

## Running Tests

Each extension can now run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

This will:
1. Compile TypeScript (`npm run compile-tests`)
2. Build the extension (`npm run compile`) 
3. Run linting (`npm run lint`)
4. Execute Mocha tests in VS Code extension host

## Migration Lessons Learned

1. **Extension Host Persistence**: VS Code extension host maintains state across tests, requiring careful handling of provider registrations
2. **Extension Discovery**: Extension identification in tests requires flexibility to handle different publisher configurations
3. **Real API Benefits**: Testing with real VS Code APIs provides much better validation than mocks
4. **Error Handling**: Real environment testing reveals edge cases that mocks might miss

The migration successfully modernizes the testing approach while providing more reliable and maintainable test suites.
